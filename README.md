# Summary
This report uses regression analysis to discover underlying health risks in mothers that may be correlated with differences in infant birthweight. This is done by applying Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) between mother health factors to model infant birthweight distribution. The mathematical theory, kernel optimization, and bandwidth selection techniques in the analysis are discussed in the report.
